<h1 align="center">Python Web Server</h1>
  
##### Project Overview:  
&ensp;&ensp;A HTTP Web Server uses Python language.

&ensp;&ensp;This HTTP Web Server uses basic Python socket programming knowledge and networking programming knowledge. The HTTP Web Server can operate at a specified port at local network. The HTTP Web Server is also able to server up to 5 clients at the same time. The Web Server is single threaded, which is possible to change to multi-threaded to enhance the performance. The web server can respond basic HTTP requests including "GET", "HEAD", and "POST". The HTTP Web Server can respond to client with HTTP errors including "200", "400", "404", and "505" and the abbility to detect requested and incoming file type to complete the clients' needs because HTTP Web Server servers the "index.html" from the root of "site" folder under the same directory and any further requests will be proccessed by the program to determine whether the program is fulfilled.

##### Operating Environment & Usage:
&ensp;&ensp;The program was in Pyhton version 2.7.9 under OSX( not sure if the program is compatible under Python 3 or newer or other OS). This project is only for academic study purpose.

##### Further Analysis:
&ensp;&ensp;The server name and port number can be edited by the user and the socket buffer size and connection experition time can be edited by user.
